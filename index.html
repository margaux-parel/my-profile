		<p>I'm 18 years old. What makes me happy in life is spending time with my love ones and practicing a lot of different sports! Be comprehensive with others but also find ressources to surpass myself are some of my core values. I created this page and the design thanks to Le Wagon.

		<h2>Sports</h2>
		<p>
			I did a lot of sports in my life: classic danse, jazz danse, horse riding, tennis. I practiced athletic in competition for 3 years and artistic gymnastic for 5 years in competition. Sport allows me to relieve pressure and take care of myself. Moreover it transmits values which are very useful both in personal and professional life such as solidarity or teamworking.

			It's very important for me to be involved in causes that are important for me. During my high school years I was UNICEF Youth Ambassadors, and now at Essec I am part of the association "childhood solidarity initiatives". We visit children in hospital and put in place events to collect toys and money to make donations.
